# console-to-do-app
A simple CLI (Command Line Interface) app that helps users organize their work with a to-do list. 

## About the project
This project is a practical exercise, based on *Part I* of *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes. It demonstrates my understanding of core Python concepts, including basic syntax, CRUD operations, and the use of both built-in (*time*) and external (*unittest*, *pytest*) Python modules.
